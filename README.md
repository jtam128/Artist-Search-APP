# Artist-Search Website

Artist-Search is a website I built while following along with Ray Villalobos' course on LinkedIn Learning called [Learning Angular](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-angular/welcome?autoplay=true).

While building this website, I learned about several features of the Angular framework. Those include the Angular CLI, declarative templates, data-binding, lifecycle methods, and the Angular pipe.

## Screenshots

When you search for a particular person, their name pops up in a list. You click on that name.

After you click on the name, the search bar clears up and you see further details about the artist, like so:
